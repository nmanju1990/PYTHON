# Data-stuctures
Dictionary
         .combination of immutable mutable data type
         .it is an collection of elements data in the format of keys and values
            *keys are immutable
            *values are mutable
         .it is an un ordered data type.but sometimes it looks like ordered data type
         .keys should be unique
          .values can be duplicated
          .it is represented with curley brackets{}
mapping data type is dictionary

## ðŸ“Œ Advanced & Performance

Explain the time complexity of list, dict, and set operations.
Why is in faster in a set or dict compared to a list?
